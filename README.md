# Minor Convenience
This mod does exactly what it says on the tin, adding several minor (and not so minor) conveniences for players on Hypixel Skyblock. 
Oh, did I mention? This is for 1.16. Notably for Forge, not Fabric.
Some features haven't yet been added. Those currently added are made more fair with certain restrictions.
Here are some notable feature differences compared to other mods:
1. The Tic Tac Toe, Ice Fill and Path, Water Puzzle, Boulder, and Bomb Defuse puzzles will NOT have a solver added for them. 
   * They are either extremely simple to solve or have very few variants. Bomb Defuse is an exception, but you should really work with your teammates anyway.
2. Higher or Lower (also known as the blaze puzzle) displays both the highest and lowest health blazes, not simply the "correct" blaze.
   * You should need to pay some attention while doing dungeons. At least do the mental footwork of knowing whether to go up or down.
3. Three Wierdos doesn't highlight the correct chest.
   * *Come on, do you really need that*? 
4. Ultrasequencer solver exists, but doesn't prevent missclicks. 
    * Missclicks happen. Practice your click accuracy!
5. Chronomatron solver does NOT exist. 
    * In all fairness, Ultrasequencer is kinda hard. Chronomatron is just simon says. I promise you can get full rewards without a solver. Also does not have missclick prevention.
6. Necron terminal solvers have no major changes outside of not including missclick prevention. 

Other features:
1. Non-strict anti-spam measures. Only immediate duplicate messages are prevented as of right now. Chat stacking is in my todo list to make it less awkward.
2. Cooldown messages and obstructed teleport-type messages are straight up disabled, you won't see them at all.
3. Likewise, you won't see "Free X million coin" messages for the same reason. At least, until they change the message.



If I think of anything else to add, I'll get to it. README is still WIP.
Consider this mod to be in beta until the code organization is finalized.
